<p style="font-size=10vw"> Dogs are a lot smarter than people give them credit for.

So how do dogs think?

Dogs don't read or write, so they don't think in words and symbols the way humans do. However, they can certainly be taught to recognise symbols and words and the actions associated with them, but this is done through very careful training and isn't their natural state.
